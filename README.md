# extraordinary-nginx-configs
I am the Mayor of NGINX - I am NGINX - I own NGINX - I master NGINX daily. Because NGINX is the future.  

# So I'm really not - but I'm pretty damn good.  
- Through my learning experience with NGINX, I have mastered it to the point where I feel comfortable.  The goal of this repo is simply to provide configurations of nginx that are not so typical - eg. when your running wordpress and a few node js apps on the same server.
